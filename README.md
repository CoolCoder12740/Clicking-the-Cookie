Members: Griffin L., Yiftach K., Braxton D.
Description: A game that resembles the cookie clicker game wih the goal to maximize the amount of cookies collected. This will be done through upgrades and powerup that will be present throughout the game. 
Architecture: There will be a cookie in the middle of the screen, for every click the user clicks the cookie, they will be given an updated score of +1 cookies to their previous score. This will progress by having certain upgrades that will change it from +1 cookie to +10 cookies and so on when the user hits a certain milestone of cookies pressed. This game will progress infintely, and will stop when the user resets the app or reloads the page. There will be certain upgrades that can also change the cookie that is present in the middle of the screen.
